Data Mining Educational App

📘 Overview

The Data Mining Educational App is an interactive Java Swing application designed to teach users about data mining in a fun and engaging way. The app is divided into three main sections:

Learn – Explore the fundamentals of data mining through text, images, and detailed explanations.

Observe – Watch an analogy-based animation that demonstrates how raw data is sorted and classified into meaningful categories.

Play – Test your knowledge with a sorting game where you act as a manager and use data mining techniques to find associations between items.

This combination of theory, visualization, and practice helps reinforce understanding of core data mining concepts.
